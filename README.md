# HealthBot

## Problem statement
The healthcare industry is always under a tremendous pressure with the lack of human resources and funds. To combat these two serious issues, more and more companies in the healthcare industry are opting for chatbots. Chatbots offer an engaging way to communicate with patients and provide them with timely information.

## Problem description
The core idea of this project is to clarify the queries about their health. People can get their queries clarified within minutes using this website. This website is integrated with azure bot service. This bot is developed with QnAmaker which is one of the services of Microsoft Azure. Users can easily interact with bot via chat. Using this bot, user can get instant information related to their health.

### Azure Services used in this project

1. QnAMaker
2. Azure Bot Service
3. Static Web Apps

For creating Question and Answer pair, I have used QnAMaker. I integreted QnAMAker with Web App bot. Then for hosting I have used Static Web App Service. Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository.
