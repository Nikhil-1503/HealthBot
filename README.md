# HealthBot

## Problem statement
Over 40% of healthcare executives consider AI will have the greatest impact on their organizations in the future. Healthcare providers are already using various types of artificial intelligence, such as predictive analytics or machine learning, to address various issues. Today, an increasing number of them are looking into chatbots.

## Problem description
The core idea of this project is to clarify the queries about their health. People can get their queries clarified within minutes using this website. This website is integrated with azure bot service. This bot is developed with QnAmaker which is one of the services of Microsoft Azure. Users can easily interact with bot via chat. Using this bot, user can get instant information related to their health.

### Azure Services used in this project

1. QnAMaker
2. Azure Bot Service
3. Static Web Apps

For creating Question and Answer pair, I have used QnAMaker. I integreted QnAMAker with Web App bot. Then for hosting I have used Static Web App Service. Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository.
